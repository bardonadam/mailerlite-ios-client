## Features

-   ✅ List of **subscribers** with the ability to filter them by state.
-   ✅ **Subscriber's** detail (tap on the email / name to copy it to clipboard).
-   ✅ Add / edit / delete subscribers.

## Requirements ⚠️

-   Xcode 10.1+
-   Swift 4.2+
-   You need to have installed [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to be able to download third-party dependencies like Firebase.

## How to run the app 🏃‍♀️

1. Go to the project directory and install third-party dependencies via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/): 

```bash
$ pod install
or
$ pod install --repo-update (in case you get warning about out-of-date source repos)
```

2. Open the Xcode workspace (**MailerLite.xcworkspace**) file instead of the project file (MailerLite.xcodeproj):

```bash
$ open MailerLite.xcworkspace
```

3. Hit the Run button (or Command + R shortcut) to run the app in the simulator.
